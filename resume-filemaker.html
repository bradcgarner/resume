			</div>

		</article>
		<article class="portal">
			<h2>Client Portal</h2>
			<p>
				Developed and implemented a <a href="https://youtu.be/mLU2R7VEBRo" target="_blank">client portal</a> via FileMaker WebDirect to deliver photographic reports to Furbish's clients. 
				<br class="breakMobile"><br class="breakMobile">Developed and implemented business processes for reporting. Reports originated in FileMaker Pro ERP, were automatically pushed to FileMaker Go for population by field crews, were automatically retrieved by the Furbish ERP for review, and were finally pushed to a separate FileMaker server on AWS for client viewing via FileMaker Web Direct. Clients are automatically notified of new reports based on their selected notification frequency. 
				<br class="breakMobile"><br class="breakMobile">Reduced effort from average of 4 man-hours per report to 1.5 man-hours; reduced delivery time from 2 weeks to 3 days; improved experiences for employees and clients.

			<h2>Construction Specification Web Application</h2>
			<p>
				Developed a FileMaker WebDirect application to allow architects to create custom, accurate, coordinated construction specifications for any type of green roof and/or any common commercial waterproofing membrane.
				<br class="breakMobile"><br class="breakMobile"> Key innovations included graphic modeling of assemblies; graphic selection of details and project conditions; collaborative data management processes to allow users, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to view and edit information (similar to editing Wikipedia).
